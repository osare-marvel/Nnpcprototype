<h1> Health, Safety and Environment</h1>

<p> In line with our Group Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) Policy Statement, NNPC is committed to conducting its activities in a manner that promotes the Health and Safety of its employees, assets and the public, as well as protection of the environment.

NNPC's Group Health, Safety and Environment Department (GHSED) is mainly responsible for the administration of corporate matters on occupational Health, Safety and Environmental protection. The Department is also responsible for formulation of practical HSE policies and guidelines in line with industry best practice, facilitate timely and comprehensive compliance while maintaining effective service delivery for the protection of staff, assets and the environment. We conduct all HSE activities with utmost degree of competence in accordance with the profession and industry standards for the benefit of the Corporation and the Nation.</p>
<br>
<p> GHSE Department has steadily and rapidly evolved over the past few years with the restructuring and change of name in 2010 from 'Environment and Safety' and the upgrade of reporting line from Division to Directorate. The Group HSE policy statement signed by the MGD was also formally launched and deployed at all NNPC locations, and the corporate-wide HSE Management System was developed, is being deployed and implemented. The practice of world class HSE Safety Management Walkthrough and Walkabout methods of engaging Top Management Staff in safety compliance monitoring and enforcement likewise kick started. We recognize that the journey to excellence which we have now embarked upon has no final destination but requires that we constantly seek opportunities, stretch targetsand redefine our strategies to ensure continuous improvement in our HSE performance.</p>
